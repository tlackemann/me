## ToM Framework
ToM (Timeline of Me) is a small personal project that creates a social timeline by pulling from a number of resources. It organizes, caches, and renders a full page webpage that features your collected works. Currently supports Twitter, Instagram, RSS, and practically any other JSON source. Currently in development to support Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Facebook, Google+, and feature article sources.

### Files
Until I "officially" open-source the project, feel free to browse the files in "api/" to understand how ToM works as a whole (look in "css/main.css" for the .tom-* classes)
